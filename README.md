# CellBit - A Plugin-based BT Downloader Built on Deno

[中文简体-README](./README.zh-cn.md)

## Introduction

CellBit is a plugin-based BT downloader developed on the Deno platform. The project name implies the similarity between cells and Peer to Peer (P2P) technology, as well as the extensibility of a plugin-based system.

## Name Origin

The name CellBit is inspired by the characteristics of cells. In biology, cells have the ability to divide and expand, while they communicate with each other through signal transmission. This communication method is similar to the node-to-node communication in P2P technology. Just as cells pass information to each other to accomplish common tasks, P2P technology allows computer nodes to directly transfer data, thus improving data transfer efficiency.

Based on this similarity, we named this BT downloader CellBit, emphasizing its efficient, distributed nature and plugin-based extensibility.

## Key Features

- Developed on the Deno platform
- Plugin-based architecture for easy extensibility
- User-friendly interface design

CellBit BT downloader is committed to providing a plugin-based solution that allows users to easily extend and customize features based on their needs. With a plugin-based architecture, CellBit can achieve a more efficient and flexible downloading experience.
